A command line emulator frontend for the demoscene


## Main goal

Make it easy to watch demos from C64 and Amiga

* Runs multiple demos in order or shuffled
* Shows demo meta data as overlay
* CRT shader for "authentic" look
* Can run Amiga/Atari/C64 exes & disk images
* Right-Alt hotkey for disk switch etc
* Can run multiple files at once in a grid


## Download

Prebuilt windows binary [here](/dl/demarc.zip)


## Build

You need _rust_.

`git clone https://github.com/sasq64/demarc.git`

`cargo build --release`

## Run

First, set your monitor to 50Hz if possible.

You need libretro libraries for the emulated system. Libraries are searched for
in `<current_dir>/libretro`, `<exec_dir>` and `/usr/lib/libretro/`

then

`cargo run -- <files>`

or

`target/release/demarc <files>`

### Windows

Libraries are in `libretro/`

If you copy the exe to your path, also copy the DLL:s and it should work

### Linux

If you installed retroarch you may have libs available in `/usr/lib/libretro`

## Shortcuts

S = Change scaling
