## TL;DR

Have been programming since 1985 (professionally since 1992), mainly in C & C++ but also C#, Java, Assembler and D. Enjoys software design from machine code level up to build systems and testing.

* Have been working at *Unity Technologies* for the last 3-4 years, on the Android/Mobile team.

* Worked at *King* for ~3 years, on several games, including *Bubble Saga* and at the end in the “Growth” team, doing C++ development for *Candy Crush Saga*.

* Started and ran a company, *Swimsuit Boys* for 4 years, where I designed and implemented a virtual machine and server for platform independent multiplayer gaming on pre-smartphone mobiles.

* Developed an application for 3D visualization of architecture and surrounding environment, including realtime shadows, at *Sightline Vision AB*.

* Worked at *Digital Illusions* as a Render programmer on *Battlefield 2*, working on things like realtime water and the lightmap renderer.

* Worked ~3.5 years  for *Amuze* on *Headhunter*, a major Dreamcast and PS2 title published by *Sega Europe*. Main tasks included porting Headhunter to PS2 and writing the multiplayer/network portion for the Dreamcast-version.

## Professional Experience

### Unity Technologies (2014-)
**Main Tasks**
* Application development in C#/C++ and Java
* Android Bug fixing

Wrote *Fastzip*, A very fast zip packer/unpacker that could also sign Android APKs on the fly; https://github.com/sasq64/fastzip

### King (2010-2013)

**Main Tasks**
* Flash & C++ games programming

Wrote the flash games *Farm King* and *Circus Surprise*, then joined the team developing the first Facebook Saga game, *Bubble Saga*. Worked on a canceled Hidden Object game based on Sherlock Holmes, and finally worked for a while on the so called Growth team where I did C++ programming for *Candy Crush Saga*.

### Swimsuitboys AB (2006 -2010)
**Main Tasks**
Design, implementation and documentation of a technology named Swimmer, a Virtual Machine for small devices. C++ and Java/J2ME.

Swimsuit Boys was a company I started together with a few old colleagues, to develop a technology I had started on my spare time; A thin client application with a fast virtual machine, and a server infrastructure that could send down code and data to connected clients.

### Sightline Vision (Nov 2005 - Nov 2006)
**Main Tasks**
* Develop an application for 3D visualization from scratch.

After Battlefield 2 was complete, I left for a smaller company that did 3D visualization, mostly of infrastructure like housing areas, airports etc. There me and the two other programmers started developing a replacement for the old application used for displaying these visualizations. Tasks included core functionality like resource, document and configuration handling - as well as advanced 3D programming like realtime (cascaded) shadow maps and tree/forest rendering (using Speedtree).

### Digital Illusion (Nov 2003 - Oct 2005 )
**Main Tasks**
* Worked on the startup of a new PS2 project and examined different platforms/middlewares to use.
* Worked as a render programmer for Battlefield 2 (PC).

I left Amuze (as many had previously and many since) because of what had become an unbearable work situation and was offered a position at Dice to help start up a new PS2 project. After several months this project was canceled however, and I was moved over to the Battlefield 2 team, where I worked in the rendering team, working on things like the lightmap renderer and the realtime water.

### Amuze V2 (Aug 2002 - Oct 2003 )
**Main Tasks**
* Core functionality in the engine for the game Headhunter: Redemption

After returning from England I went back to Amuze who had just started up again in it’s new form. For the sequel to Headhunter, instead of writing everything ourselves a lot of third-party products was used. Renderware and Renderware Studio from Criterion was chosen, together with other game middleware such as Karma (for physics) and Kynogon (for AI). I have mostly been working on core functionality such as the texture cache/streaming, memory system, a visibility manager and PS2-specific parts.

### Reflections Interactive (Jan 2002 - Jun 2002)
**Main Tasks**
Writing a spline road renderer for Driver 3

After Amuze had to let everyone because of economical problems I choose to move to England to start work as a render programmer for Reflections Interactive in Newcastle (Creators of the Driver games, and recently Stuntman). I was assigned to writing the spline renderer for the roads in Driver 3. However, l did not enjoy England at all and unfortunatly I had to resign after only 5 months.

### Amuze Electronic Media (May 2000 - Dec 2001)
**Main Tasks**
* Network Programming for the Dreamcast version of Headhunter
* Porting Headhunter from Dreamcast to PlayStation 2

When I started at Amuze I jumped right into the development of Headhunter, one of Sega Europe's biggest productions. After working on smaller tasks in the game-engine, my previous work with network programming got me assigned to the task of writing the multiplayer portions of Headhunter. However, due to financial problems, Sega decided to cut the multiplayer gaming in favor of a PS2-port. Even though I was sorry to leave the nearly finished online racing code and server behind, I quickly set myself out to learn the PS2-hardware. The last months at Amuze I ported most of Dreamcast 3D-engine to PS2, learning a lot about porting between different hardware in the process. Finally, as we could move some people over from the Dreamcast-version, I also had to act as a teamleader for other programmers while still trying to maintain focus on programming.

### Upright Technology (Apr 1997 - May 2000)
**Main Tasks**
* Middleware and Database service programming in C/C++
* Some Java programming (Applets and Java Server Pages)

I left Webray for Upright, a more traditional IT-company, where I worked on many different projects. These included:

**Ericsson**<br>
Short project to rewrite/update parser software used for switchboard development.

**ABB Lummus Global**<br>
Upright was a sub-contractor for ABB Lummus Global, who in turn had the gigantic task of upgrading and modernizing the oil facilities of Lagoven, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company. I worked mostly with the middleware (Tuxedo from BEA), the layer of service-routines that dictated the access to the database.

**RFV**<br>
I worked together with a lot of other programmers and people from RFV to modernize the case handling system for the Swedish National Security organization.

**OK/Q8**<br>
A prototype for a car-rental system that I was a project-leader for but which wasn’t finished by the time I left the company.

**Spray**<br>
I worked on their WAP-portal, writing java server pages for spray mail and such.


### Webray Operator Systems (Fall 1992, Mars 1994 - Apr 1997)
**Main Tasks**
* Low-level (Assembler, Pascal, C) communication and measurement programming

Webray was a company that developed software and sold measure-instruments to the paper industry. My work mainly involved writing communication-software that parsed measurement data and made them available to windows-clients, but I also wrote a lot of low-level code to actually perform the measuring - both in x86 assembler and stranger languages like Forth (!) and PLC (Programmable Logic Circuits) assembler. The job also involved a lot of on-site programming and support which could be exiting at times, especially since a programming error could cut the paper and stop the machine which usually cost the paper company around $10000 - $15000 per hour.
